## Overview
This is my second challenge from frontend. I will try to use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) to build the website.

It will be fun.
### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Main Design in CSS not use in original picture file.

## My process
### Built with
- Import Image and Default Setting from Figma
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Poistion
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [tailwindcss](https://https://tailwindcss.com/) - For css

## New Stuff for me
- know the "pictures" Html tags, which use in different device
  - know height setting for responsive
Example: on mobile
  ```css
  height: 120px;
  ```
  - on tablet (which I want to change height)
  ```css
  height: auto;
  ```
- Use the `flex-grow` property to make elements expand and fill available space.
- Set the rotation of an element using `transform-origin` property
- To vertically center the `<a>` element, use `padding` to solve it.
### Continued development

After completing this challenge, I'm eager to delve deeper into tailwindcss and apply it to other projects. 

Additionally, I'm excited to explore how to integrate APIs into different frameworks and leverage their capabilities. 
### Useful resources
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - The Ultimate CSS Solution for Web Designers! I learned techniques for  mastering flexbox and gaining complete control over my layout. 
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) - I assigned myself additional homework for this challenge, and I have found it to be extremely valuable.
